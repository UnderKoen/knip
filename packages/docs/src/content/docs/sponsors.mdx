Knip is a powerful tool that helps thousands of developers keep their JavaScript
and TypeScript projects lean and maintainable. Knip saves teams valuable time
and resources.

Building and maintaining Knip has been, and remains, a lot of work. Supportive
resources allow me to focus on maintenance and development of Knip, which is
[relied upon][1] [by many][2] in the JavaScript community. Please consider
supporting the project! The following platforms are available to support Knip:

- [GitHub Sponsors][3]
- [OpenCollective][4]

You or your company logo with a backlink to your website will be added to this
page if you decide to support the project on an ongoing basis. Eternal gratitude
to the companies and people supporting the project!

## Monthly Overview

Overview of gross GitHub and OpenCollective sponsorships and invoices, starting
from the moment the project openly asked for support. Actual development started
one year before that.

<SponsorsChart />

- The monthly aggregated average over the charted period is $506.
- The monthly recurring average without one-time payments is $323.
- GitHub Sponsors is for my GitHub account. This has more repositories, but in
  practice targets mostly Knip (and perhaps some [release-it][5]).
